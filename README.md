Neural Forge is an experimental AI engineering system that attempts to:

- **🧠 Mimic Associative Memory**: Implements cascading activation patterns between related concepts
- **⚡ Apply Rules Contextually**: Aims to silently apply relevant engineering principles based on context
- **🔄 Track Usage**: Designed to learn from usage patterns (implementation pending)
- **🌐 Connect Domains**: Links knowledge across security, performance, architecture, and testing
- **🎯 Recognize Context**: Attempts to automatically detect engineering scenarios and activate relevant knowledge

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### 🧠 **Human-Like Associative Memory**

- **Cascading Activation**: Primary tokens trigger related tokens across categories
- **Strength-Based Prioritization**: Associative strength values (0.7-0.9) determine activation
- **Context Weighting**: Usage frequency and success rates influence token selection
- **Cross-Domain Links**: Security tokens connect to performance, architecture, and testing

### ⚡ **Autonomous Operation**

- **Silent Enforcement**: Applies engineering principles without explicit prompting
- **Context Recognition**: Automatically detects API development, data processing, testing scenarios
- **Intelligent Activation**: Uses semantic triggers and keyword matching
- **Pattern Learning**: Creates new tokens for novel successful patterns

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### 1. **Context Recognition**

```yaml
api_development:
  triggers: ["endpoint", "route", "API", "service"]
  primary_activation: ["APIDesignPrinciples", "InputSanitization", "AuthBypassPrevention"]
  cascading_pattern:
    - APIDesignPrinciples → MicroservicesPatterns, EventSourcingCQRS
    - InputSanitization → SecurityHeaders, ThreatModel
    - AuthBypassPrevention → ZeroTrustArchitecture, OAuth2JWTPatterns
```

### 2. **Associative Activation**

```yaml
activation_algorithm:
  primary_threshold: 0.7  # Minimum strength for activation
  cascading_rules:
    - strength_0.9+: "cascade_to_all_direct_links"
    - strength_0.8-0.89: "cascade_to_top_3_links"
    - strength_0.7-0.79: "cascade_to_top_2_links"
  context_weighting:
    - usage_frequency: 1.2x multiplier
    - success_context: 1.3x multiplier
```

### 3. **Learning & Adaptation**

```yaml
learning_mechanisms:
  usage_tracking: "Monitor token activation frequency and success"
  strength_calibration: "Adjust associations based on effectiveness"
  pattern_recognition: "Identify successful token combinations"
  cross_session_memory: "Preserve learning across sessions"
```

## 🎯 **Vision**

Neural Forge is an experiment in creating more intelligent AI-assisted software engineering. The goal is to move beyond static rule lists toward a system that can contextually apply engineering knowledge.

**The hypothesis**: By implementing associative memory patterns and context recognition, we can create AI systems that apply engineering principles more intelligently and learn from their usage patterns.
