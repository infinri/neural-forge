principles:
  - "Never trust user input - validate everything"
  - "Principle of least privilege"
  - "Defense in depth - multiple security layers"
  - "Fail securely - errors shouldn't expose data"
  - "Security by design, not as an afterthought"
threats:
  - SQL injection via parameterized queries
  - XSS via output encoding
  - CSRF via tokens and SameSite cookies
  - Authentication bypass via proper session management
  - Data exposure via encryption at rest/transit
practices:
  - Hash passwords with salt (bcrypt/scrypt)
  - Use HTTPS everywhere
  - Implement rate limiting
  - Log security events (not sensitive data)
  - Regular dependency updates
