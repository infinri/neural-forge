  # Supporting Patterns
  - code-quality/SOLID
  - data/DatabaseDesign
  - reliability/CircuitBreakerPatterns
  - reliability/ObservabilityPatterns
  - security/ZeroTrustArchitecture
principles:
  - "Loose coupling, high cohesion"
  - "Separate concerns by domain boundaries"
  - "Design for failure and recovery"
  - "Stateless services where possible"
  - "Data consistency over availability when critical"
patterns:
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - Factory pattern for object creation
  - Observer pattern for event handling
  - Circuit breaker for fault tolerance
  - CQRS for read/write separation
