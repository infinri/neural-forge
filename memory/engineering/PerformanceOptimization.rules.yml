  # Related Patterns
  - data/DataPipelinePatterns
  - testing/PerformanceTestingPatterns
principles:
  - "Measure before optimizing - profile first"
  - "Optimize critical paths, not everything"
  - "Choose right data structures for access patterns"
  - "Minimize I/O operations and network calls"
  - "Cache expensive computations and queries"
patterns:
  - Lazy loading for deferred initialization
  - Connection pooling for database access
  - Batch processing for bulk operations
  - Async/await for non-blocking operations
  - Pagination for large datasets
optimization:
  - Time complexity: O(1) > O(log n) > O(n) > O(nÂ²)
  - Space complexity: minimize memory allocations
  - Database: use indexes, avoid N+1 queries
  - Caching: Redis/Memcached for hot data
  - CDN: static assets and geographic distribution
