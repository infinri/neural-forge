  - "Ensure performance considerations are addressed"
  - "Validate test coverage and quality"
  - "Review for maintainability and readability"
  - "Check for proper error handling"
selfAssessmentChecklist:
  - "Security: Are inputs validated and outputs sanitized?"
  - "Performance: Is the algorithm complexity appropriate?"
  - "Maintainability: Is the code DRY and following SOLID?"
  - "Testing: Are there adequate tests with good coverage?"
  - "Documentation: Are complex parts properly documented?"
  - "Error Handling: Are edge cases and failures handled?"
automatedChecks:
  - "Static code analysis for potential issues"
  - "Security vulnerability scanning"
  - "Performance profiling and bottleneck detection"
  - "Test coverage analysis"
