description: "Technical debt identification, tracking, and remediation strategies"
appliesTo:
  - "Legacy code maintenance"
  - "Code quality improvement planning"
  - "Refactoring prioritization"
  - "Development velocity optimization"
  - "Risk assessment and mitigation"
patterns:
  - "Identify and catalog technical debt systematically"
  - "Quantify debt impact on development velocity"
  - "Prioritize debt remediation based on business value"
  - "Integrate debt reduction into regular development cycles"
  - "Track debt metrics and trends over time"
bestPractices:
  - "Make technical debt visible to stakeholders"
  - "Allocate dedicated time for debt reduction (20% rule)"
  - "Address debt incrementally rather than in large chunks"
  - "Prevent new debt through code review and standards"
  - "Document debt decisions and their business rationale"
  - "Use automated tools to detect and track debt"
  - "Regularly reassess debt priorities as business needs change"
debtIdentification:
  - "Code smells: Long methods, large classes, duplicate code"
  - "Architecture violations: Circular dependencies, layer violations"
  - "Outdated dependencies: Security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues"
  - "Missing tests: Low coverage areas with high business risk"
  - "Documentation gaps: Undocumented APIs and complex algorithms"
  - "Performance issues: Known bottlenecks and scalability problems"
debtQuantification:
  - "Time to understand: How long to comprehend code sections"
  - "Change difficulty: Effort required to modify functionality"
  - "Bug frequency: Areas with higher defect rates"
  - "Development velocity impact: Features slowed by debt"
  - "Maintenance cost: Ongoing effort to work around debt"
prioritizationFramework:
  - "High impact, low effort: Quick wins for immediate improvement"
  - "High impact, high effort: Major refactoring projects"
  - "Business criticality: Debt in revenue-critical systems"
  - "Change frequency: Debt in frequently modified code"
  - "Risk assessment: Potential for production issues"
remediationStrategies:
  - "Strangler Fig Pattern: Gradually replace legacy systems"
  - "Boy Scout Rule: Leave code better than you found it"
  - "Dedicated debt sprints: Focused debt reduction periods"
  - "Opportunistic refactoring: Improve code while adding features"
  - "Architecture decision records: Document debt decisions"
trackingMechanisms:
  - "Debt backlog: Maintain prioritized list of debt items"
  - "Debt metrics dashboard: Visualize debt trends and progress"
  - "Code quality gates: Prevent new debt introduction"
  - "Regular debt reviews: Team discussions on debt status"
  - "Debt impact reports: Business impact of unaddressed debt"
preventionStrategies:
  - "Definition of Done: Include quality criteria in completion"
  - "Code review standards: Catch debt before it enters codebase"
  - "Automated quality checks: Static analysis and linting"
  - "Architecture guidelines: Prevent structural debt"
  - "Regular refactoring: Continuous code improvement"
businessCommunication:
  - "Translate technical debt into business terms"
  - "Show impact on feature delivery and maintenance costs"
  - "Provide clear ROI calculations for debt reduction"
  - "Regular stakeholder updates on debt status"
  - "Risk communication: Potential consequences of unaddressed debt"
toolsAndMetrics:
  - "SonarQube: Technical debt ratio and remediation effort"
  - "Code Climate: Maintainability and technical debt tracking"
