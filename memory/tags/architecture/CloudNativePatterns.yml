description: "Cloud-native architecture patterns for scalable, resilient applications"
appliesTo:
  - "Container orchestration and management"
  - "Serverless and function-as-a-service architectures"
  - "Auto-scaling and resource optimization"
  - "Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies"
  - "Cloud-native security and compliance"
patterns:
  - "Design applications as stateless, horizontally scalable services"
  - "Use containers for consistent deployment across environments"
  - "Implement auto-scaling based on metrics and demand"
  - "Use managed cloud services to reduce operational overhead"
  - "Design for failure with redundancy and graceful degradation"
bestPractices:
  - "Follow the twelve-factor app methodology"
  - "Implement infrastructure as code (IaC)"
  - "Use immutable infrastructure patterns"
  - "Implement proper service mesh for microservices"
  - "Use cloud-native storage and database solutions"
  - "Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability"
  - "Design for multi-region deployment and disaster recovery"
containerPatterns:
  - "Single responsibility: One process per container"
  - "Immutable containers: Build once, deploy anywhere"
  - "Layered images: Optimize for size and caching"
  - "Health checks: Implement proper liveness and readiness probes"
  - "Resource limits: Set appropriate CPU and memory constraints"
orchestrationPatterns:
  - "Declarative configuration: Define desired state, not imperative steps"
  - "Service discovery: Automatic service registration and lookup"
  - "Load balancing: Distribute traffic across healthy instances"
  - "Rolling updates: Zero-downtime deployments"
  - "Horizontal pod autoscaling: Scale based on resource utilization"
serverlessPatterns:
  - "Event-driven functions: Trigger functions based on events"
  - "Stateless execution: Functions should not maintain state"
  - "Cold start optimization: Minimize function initialization time"
  - "Function composition: Chain functions for complex workflows"
  - "Pay-per-use: Optimize for cost efficiency"
scalingStrategies:
  - "Horizontal scaling: Add more instances rather than bigger instances"
  - "Auto-scaling: Automatically adjust capacity based on demand"
  - "Predictive scaling: Scale proactively based on patterns"
  - "Multi-dimensional scaling: Scale based on multiple metrics"
  - "Cost optimization: Balance performance and cost"
storagePatterns:
  - "Persistent volumes: Durable storage for stateful applications"
  - "Object storage: Scalable storage for unstructured data"
  - "Database as a service: Managed database solutions"
  - "Caching layers: Distributed caching for performance"
  - "Data replication: Multi-region data distribution"
securityPatterns:
  - "Zero trust networking: Verify every connection"
  - "Identity and access management: Centralized authentication"
  - "Secrets management: Secure storage and rotation of credentials"
  - "Network policies: Micro-segmentation for container networks"
  - "Image scanning: Vulnerability scanning for container images"
observabilityPatterns:
  - "Distributed tracing: Track requests across services"
  - "Centralized logging: Aggregate logs from all services"
  - "Metrics collection: Comprehensive system and business metrics"
  - "Service mesh observability: Traffic and performance insights"
  - "Cost monitoring: Track and optimize cloud spending"
deploymentPatterns:
  - "Blue-green deployment: Zero-downtime deployments"
  - "Canary releases: Gradual rollout with monitoring"
  - "Feature flags: Decouple deployment from feature release"
  - "GitOps: Git-based deployment and configuration management"
  - "Progressive delivery: Automated rollout based on success metrics"
multiCloudStrategies:
  - "Cloud abstraction: Use cloud-agnostic tools and patterns"
  - "Data sovereignty: Keep data in required geographic regions"
  - "Vendor lock-in avoidance: Use open standards and portable solutions"
  - "Cost optimization: Leverage different cloud providers' strengths"
  - "Disaster recovery: Cross-cloud backup and failover strategies"
toolsAndPlatforms:
  - "Kubernetes: Container orchestration platform"
  - "Docker: Containerization technology"
