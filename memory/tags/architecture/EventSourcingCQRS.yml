description: "Event sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation patterns"
appliesTo:
  - "Event-driven architecture design"
  - "Audit trail and compliance requirements"
  - "High-performance read/write separation"
  - "Temporal data modeling"
  - "Distributed system state management"
patterns:
  - "Store events instead of current state for complete audit trail"
  - "Separate command and query models for optimal performance"
  - "Use event streams as the source of truth"
  - "Implement event replay for system recovery and testing"
  - "Design events as immutable facts about what happened"
bestPractices:
  - "Design events to be immutable and append-only"
  - "Use meaningful event names that describe business actions"
  - "Include sufficient context in events for future processing"
  - "Implement event versioning for schema evolution"
  - "Use snapshots to optimize event replay performance"
  - "Separate read and write models based on usage patterns"
  - "Implement proper event ordering and causality"
eventSourcing:
  - "Event store: Persistent storage for all domain events"
  - "Event streams: Ordered sequences of events per aggregate"
  - "Event replay: Reconstruct state by replaying events"
  - "Snapshots: Periodic state captures to optimize replay"
  - "Event versioning: Handle schema changes over time"
cqrsPatterns:
  - "Command model: Optimized for writes and business logic"
  - "Query model: Optimized for reads and reporting"
  - "Projection: Transform events into read-optimized views"
  - "Denormalization: Duplicate data for query performance"
  - "Eventually consistent: Accept temporary inconsistency"
eventDesign:
  - "Domain events: Business-meaningful occurrences"
  - "Event payload: Include all necessary context"
  - "Event metadata: Timestamp, correlation ID, causation ID"
  - "Event versioning: Support for schema evolution"
  - "Event naming: Use past tense verb phrases"
aggregatePatterns:
  - "Aggregate root: Single entry point for command handling"
  - "Event generation: Aggregates produce events from commands"
  - "State reconstruction: Rebuild aggregate state from events"
  - "Invariant enforcement: Maintain business rules consistency"
  - "Optimistic concurrency: Handle concurrent modifications"
projectionStrategies:
  - "Real-time projections: Update views as events occur"
  - "Batch projections: Process events in scheduled batches"
  - "Multiple projections: Different views for different use cases"
  - "Projection rebuilding: Recreate views from event history"
  - "Projection versioning: Handle view schema changes"
eventStore:
  - "Append-only storage: Events are never modified or deleted"
  - "Stream partitioning: Organize events by aggregate or tenant"
  - "Event ordering: Maintain global or per-stream ordering"
  - "Concurrency control: Handle concurrent event appends"
  - "Event querying: Efficient retrieval of event ranges"
implementationConsiderations:
  - "Event store selection: Purpose-built vs general-purpose databases"
  - "Serialization: JSON, Avro, or Protocol Buffers for events"
  - "Performance: Optimize for high write throughput"
  - "Scalability: Horizontal scaling strategies"
  - "Backup and recovery: Event store backup strategies"
complexityManagement:
  - "Start simple: Begin with basic event sourcing patterns"
  - "Gradual adoption: Introduce CQRS where it adds value"
  - "Bounded contexts: Apply patterns within specific domains"
  - "Team expertise: Ensure team understands the patterns"
  - "Tooling support: Use appropriate frameworks and libraries"

  - "Event stores: EventStore, Apache Kafka, AWS EventBridge"
  - "Frameworks: Axon Framework, NEventStore, Eventuous"
  - "Projection engines: Kafka Streams, Apache Flink"
