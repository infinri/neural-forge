## üöÄ **Implementation Guidance**

### **Architecture-First Development Workflow**

1. **System Design Phase**
   - Apply `DistributedSystems` principles for overall architecture
   - Use `MicroservicesPatterns` for service decomposition
   - Design with `APIDesign` standards for interfaces

2. **Infrastructure Planning**
   - Implement `LoadBalancing` for traffic distribution
   - Plan `ContainerOrchestration` for deployment strategy
   - Design `ServiceMesh` for service communication

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - Configure `MessageQueues` for async communication
   - Apply `EventSourcing` for state management
   - Implement `APIDesign` for service interfaces

4. **Operational Architecture**
   - Deploy with `ContainerOrchestration` platforms
   - Monitor through `ServiceMesh` observability
   - Scale with `LoadBalancing` strategies

### **Common Architecture Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

- **Distributed Monolith**: Use proper `MicroservicesPatterns` boundaries
- **Chatty Interfaces**: Apply efficient `APIDesign` principles
- **Single Point of Failure**: Implement `LoadBalancing` and redundancy
- **Tight Coupling**: Use `MessageQueues` for loose coupling
- **Manual Scaling**: Leverage `ContainerOrchestration` automation
