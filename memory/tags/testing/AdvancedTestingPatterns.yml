description: "Advanced testing patterns including contract, property-based, and mutation testing"
appliesTo:
  - "Contract testing for API compatibility"
  - "Property-based testing for comprehensive coverage"
  - "Mutation testing for test quality assessment"
  - "Fuzz testing for security and robustness"
  - "Snapshot testing for UI and output validation"
patterns:
  - "Use contract testing to verify API compatibility between services"
  - "Implement property-based testing for comprehensive input validation"
  - "Use mutation testing to assess test suite quality"
  - "Implement fuzz testing for security vulnerability discovery"
  - "Use snapshot testing for consistent output validation"
bestPractices:
  - "Combine multiple testing approaches for comprehensive coverage"
  - "Use test generators to create diverse test scenarios"
  - "Implement proper test isolation and cleanup"
  - "Use deterministic test data for reproducible results"
  - "Implement test categorization for selective execution"
  - "Use visual regression testing for UI components"
  - "Implement chaos testing for system resilience"
contractTesting:
  - "Consumer-driven contracts: Consumers define expected API behavior"
  - "Provider verification: Verify providers meet consumer expectations"
  - "Contract evolution: Handle API changes without breaking consumers"
  - "Bi-directional contracts: Both consumer and provider define contracts"
  - "Contract testing in CI/CD: Automated contract verification"
propertyBasedTesting:
  - "Property definition: Define invariants that should always hold"
  - "Input generation: Automatically generate diverse test inputs"
  - "Shrinking: Minimize failing test cases to simplest form"
  - "Stateful testing: Test sequences of operations"
  - "Model-based testing: Use models to generate test scenarios"
mutationTesting:
  - "Mutation operators: Introduce small changes to code"
  - "Mutant killing: Tests should fail when code is mutated"
  - "Mutation score: Percentage of mutants killed by tests"
  - "Equivalent mutants: Mutations that don't change behavior"
  - "Test improvement: Use mutation results to improve test quality"
fuzzTesting:
  - "Input fuzzing: Generate random or malformed inputs"
  - "Protocol fuzzing: Test network protocol implementations"
  - "File format fuzzing: Test file parsing and processing"
  - "API fuzzing: Test REST and GraphQL APIs with invalid inputs"
  - "Coverage-guided fuzzing: Use code coverage to guide input generation"
snapshotTesting:
  - "Output snapshots: Capture and compare program outputs"
  - "UI snapshots: Test visual appearance of user interfaces"
  - "Serialization snapshots: Test object serialization formats"
  - "Snapshot updates: Handle legitimate changes to expected outputs"
  - "Snapshot organization: Organize snapshots for maintainability"
visualRegressionTesting:
  - "Screenshot comparison: Compare visual appearance across changes"
  - "Cross-browser testing: Test appearance across different browsers"
  - "Responsive testing: Test appearance at different screen sizes"
  - "Accessibility testing: Verify accessibility compliance"
  - "Performance testing: Test visual performance metrics"
chaosTestingPatterns:
  - "Infrastructure chaos: Introduce failures in infrastructure"
  - "Application chaos: Introduce failures in application code"
  - "Network chaos: Simulate network partitions and delays"
  - "Resource chaos: Exhaust system resources"
  - "Time chaos: Manipulate system time and clocks"
testDataManagement:
  - "Test data builders: Create test data programmatically"
  - "Data factories: Generate realistic test data"
  - "Test data isolation: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other"
  - "Synthetic data: Generate artificial data for testing"
  - "Test data versioning: Manage test data changes over time"
testOrganization:
  - "Test categorization: Organize tests by type, speed, and purpose"
  - "Test suites: Group related tests for execution"
  - "Test tags: Label tests for selective execution"
  - "Test parallelization: Run tests concurrently for speed"
  - "Test prioritization: Run most important tests first"
toolsAndFrameworks:
  - "Contract testing: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract, Postman"
  - "Property-based: QuickCheck, Hypothesis, fast-check"
  - "Mutation testing: PIT, Stryker, MutPy"
  - "Fuzz testing: AFL, libFuzzer, OSS-Fuzz"
  - "Visual testing: Percy, Chromatic, Applitools"
