description: "Test data management patterns for reliable and maintainable testing"
appliesTo:
  - "Test data creation and lifecycle management"
  - "Data isolation between test runs"
  - "Synthetic and anonymized data generation"
  - "Test database setup and teardown"
  - "Cross-environment data consistency"
patterns:
  - "Use test data builders for flexible data creation"
  - "Implement proper test data isolation and cleanup"
  - "Generate synthetic data that mimics production characteristics"
  - "Use database transactions for test isolation"
  - "Implement data factories for complex object creation"
bestPractices:
  - "Create minimal test data required for each test"
  - "Use deterministic data generation for reproducible tests"
  - "Implement proper cleanup after each test"
  - "Use realistic data that represents production scenarios"
  - "Avoid shared test data that creates dependencies between tests"
  - "Version test data schemas alongside application schemas"
  - "Implement data privacy protection in test environments"
testDataCreation:
  - "Object mothers: Pre-configured objects for common scenarios"
  - "Test data builders: Fluent APIs for flexible data creation"
  - "Data factories: Generate objects with realistic relationships"
  - "Fixtures: Static test data files for consistent scenarios"
  - "Synthetic generators: Programmatically create realistic data"
dataIsolation:
  - "Database transactions: Rollback changes after each test"
  - "Test databases: Separate databases for each test run"
  - "Data partitioning: Logical separation of test data"
  - "Cleanup strategies: Explicit cleanup of test data"
  - "Containerized databases: Fresh database instances for tests"
syntheticDataGeneration:
  - "Faker libraries: Generate realistic fake data"
  - "Data relationships: Maintain referential integrity"
  - "Realistic distributions: Match production data patterns"
  - "Localization: Generate data for different locales"
  - "Volume scaling: Generate appropriate data volumes"
testEnvironmentManagement:
  - "Environment parity: Consistent data across environments"
  - "Data refresh: Regular updates from production (anonymized)"
  - "Schema migration: Keep test schemas synchronized"
  - "Seed data: Essential data for application functionality"
  - "Configuration management: Environment-specific settings"
dataPrivacyAndSecurity:
  - "Data anonymization: Remove or mask personal information"
  - "Data pseudonymization: Replace identifiers with fake values"
  - "Access controls: Restrict access to sensitive test data"
  - "Data retention: Manage lifecycle of test data"
  - "Compliance: Ensure test data meets regulatory requirements"
performanceConsiderations:
  - "Data volume optimization: Use appropriate data sizes"
  - "Database indexing: Optimize test database performance"
  - "Parallel execution: Handle concurrent test data access"
  - "Caching strategies: Cache frequently used test data"
  - "Resource cleanup: Free resources after test completion"
toolsAndFrameworks:
  - "Factory libraries: FactoryBot, Factory Boy, ObjectMother"
  - "Faker libraries: Faker.js, Python Faker, Java Faker"
  - "Database tools: Testcontainers, H2, SQLite"
  - "Data generation: Mockaroo, GenerateData, Bogus"
  - "Migration tools: Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic"
