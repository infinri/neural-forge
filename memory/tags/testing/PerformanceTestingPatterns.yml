description: "Performance testing patterns for load, stress, and scalability testing"
appliesTo:
  - "Load testing for expected traffic volumes"
  - "Stress testing for system breaking points"
  - "Scalability testing for growth planning"
  - "Endurance testing for long-running stability"
  - "Spike testing for traffic surge handling"
patterns:
  - "Design realistic load scenarios based on production traffic patterns"
  - "Implement gradual load ramp-up to identify performance thresholds"
  - "Use performance baselines to detect regressions"
  - "Test individual components and end-to-end user journeys"
  - "Implement continuous performance testing in CI/CD pipelines"
bestPractices:
  - "Test in production-like environments with realistic data volumes"
  - "Monitor system resources during performance tests"
  - "Use realistic user behavior patterns and think times"
  - "Test with production-like network conditions and latency"
  - "Implement proper test data management for consistent results"
  - "Set clear performance criteria and acceptance thresholds"
  - "Analyze results holistically, not just response times"
testTypes:
  - "Load testing: Normal expected load conditions"
  - "Stress testing: Beyond normal capacity to find breaking points"
  - "Spike testing: Sudden increases in load"
  - "Volume testing: Large amounts of data processing"
  - "Endurance testing: Extended periods of normal load"
  - "Scalability testing: System behavior as load increases"
loadModeling:
  - "User journey mapping: Realistic user interaction patterns"
  - "Traffic distribution: Proportional load across different operations"
  - "Think time: Realistic delays between user actions"
  - "Ramp-up patterns: Gradual increase to target load"
  - "Peak and off-peak scenarios: Different load patterns"
metricsAndKPIs:
  - "Response time: 95th percentile response times"
  - "Throughput: Requests or transactions per second"
  - "Error rate: Percentage of failed requests"
  - "Resource utilization: CPU, memory, disk, network usage"
  - "Concurrency: Number of simultaneous users or connections"
bottleneckIdentification:
  - "Database performance: Query execution times and connection pools"
  - "Application server: CPU and memory utilization"
  - "Network bandwidth: Data transfer rates and latency"
  - "External dependencies: Third-party service response times"
  - "Caching effectiveness: Cache hit rates and performance impact"
testEnvironment:
  - "Production-like infrastructure: Similar hardware and configuration"
  - "Realistic data volumes: Production-sized datasets"
  - "Network simulation: Realistic latency and bandwidth"
  - "Load balancer configuration: Same as production setup"
  - "Monitoring tools: Same observability stack as production"
automationPatterns:
  - "CI/CD integration: Automated performance testing in pipelines"
  - "Performance gates: Block deployments that don't meet criteria"
  - "Trend analysis: Track performance changes over time"
  - "Alerting: Notify teams of performance regressions"
  - "Reporting: Automated performance test reports"
testDataManagement:
  - "Synthetic data generation: Create realistic test datasets"
  - "Data refresh: Keep test data current and representative"
  - "Data isolation: Prevent test interference"
  - "Data cleanup: Manage test data lifecycle"
  - "Data privacy: Anonymize production data for testing"
