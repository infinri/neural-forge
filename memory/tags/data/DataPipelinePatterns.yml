description: "Data pipeline patterns for ETL, streaming, and real-time data processing"
appliesTo:
  - "Extract, transform, load (ETL) processes"
  - "Real-time data streaming and processing"
  - "Data warehouse and analytics pipelines"
  - "Machine learning data preparation"
  - "Data quality and validation workflows"
patterns:
  - "Design idempotent data transformations for reliable processing"
  - "Implement schema evolution and backward compatibility"
  - "Use event-driven architectures for real-time data processing"
  - "Implement proper error handling and dead letter queues"
  - "Use checkpointing for fault-tolerant stream processing"
bestPractices:
  - "Design pipelines to be testable and monitorable"
  - "Implement data lineage tracking for governance"
  - "Use appropriate batch sizes for optimal performance"
  - "Implement data quality checks at each stage"
  - "Design for horizontal scalability and parallel processing"
  - "Use immutable data transformations where possible"
  - "Implement proper backpressure handling"
etlPatterns:
  - "Extract: Pull data from various source systems"
  - "Transform: Clean, validate, and structure data"
  - "Load: Store processed data in target systems"
  - "Incremental processing: Process only changed data"
  - "Full refresh: Complete data reload when necessary"
streamProcessing:
  - "Event streaming: Process continuous data streams"
  - "Windowing: Group events by time or count windows"
  - "Stateful processing: Maintain state across events"
  - "Exactly-once processing: Ensure no duplicate processing"
  - "Late data handling: Process events that arrive out of order"
dataQuality:
  - "Schema validation: Ensure data conforms to expected structure"
  - "Data profiling: Analyze data characteristics and quality"
  - "Anomaly detection: Identify unusual patterns in data"
  - "Completeness checks: Verify all required data is present"
  - "Consistency validation: Ensure data relationships are valid"
errorHandling:
  - "Dead letter queues: Handle records that can't be processed"
  - "Retry mechanisms: Attempt reprocessing of failed records"
  - "Circuit breakers: Stop processing when downstream systems fail"
  - "Graceful degradation: Continue processing when possible"
  - "Error enrichment: Add context to error records for debugging"
scalabilityPatterns:
  - "Horizontal partitioning: Distribute data across multiple workers"
  - "Auto-scaling: Adjust processing capacity based on load"
  - "Load balancing: Distribute work evenly across processors"
  - "Caching: Cache frequently accessed data and computations"
  - "Compression: Reduce data transfer and storage costs"
monitoringAndObservability:
  - "Pipeline metrics: Track throughput, latency, and error rates"
  - "Data lineage: Track data flow from source to destination"
  - "Data quality metrics: Monitor data quality over time"
  - "Resource utilization: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage"
  - "Business metrics: Track pipeline impact on business outcomes"
toolsAndFrameworks:
  - "Apache Airflow: Workflow orchestration platform"
  - "Apache Kafka: Event streaming platform"
  - "Apache Spark: Large-scale data processing engine"
  - "Apache Flink: Stream processing framework"
  - "dbt: Data transformation tool for analytics"
