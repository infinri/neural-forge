description: "Database migration and schema evolution patterns for production systems"
appliesTo:
  - "Database schema changes and versioning"
  - "Data transformation and migration"
  - "Zero-downtime deployment strategies"
  - "Legacy system modernization"
  - "Multi-environment data synchronization"
patterns:
  - "Use versioned migrations with forward and backward compatibility"
  - "Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime migrations"
  - "Use expand-contract pattern for breaking schema changes"
  - "Implement data validation and rollback mechanisms"
  - "Use incremental migration strategies for large datasets"
bestPractices:
  - "Test migrations thoroughly in staging environments"
  - "Implement automated rollback procedures"
  - "Use database-agnostic migration tools when possible"
  - "Monitor migration performance and impact"
  - "Implement proper backup and recovery procedures"
  - "Document all migration steps and dependencies"
  - "Use feature flags to decouple schema changes from code deployment"
migrationStrategies:
  - "Big bang: Complete migration in single operation"
  - "Incremental: Migrate data in smaller batches"
  - "Parallel run: Run old and new systems simultaneously"
  - "Phased migration: Migrate different components separately"
  - "Strangler fig: Gradually replace legacy system"
schemaEvolution:
  - "Additive changes: Add new columns/tables without breaking existing code"
  - "Expand-contract: Add new schema, migrate data, remove old schema"
  - "Versioned schemas: Maintain multiple schema versions simultaneously"
  - "Backward compatibility: Ensure old code works with new schema"
  - "Forward compatibility: Design schema to handle future changes"
zeroDowntimePatterns:
  - "Blue-green deployment: Switch between two identical environments"
  - "Rolling deployment: Update instances gradually"
  - "Shadow migration: Migrate data in background while serving traffic"
  - "Read replica migration: Migrate read replicas first, then promote"
  - "Database proxy: Route traffic during migration"
dataValidation:
  - "Pre-migration validation: Verify data integrity before migration"
  - "Post-migration validation: Confirm successful data transfer"
  - "Checksum validation: Verify data hasn't been corrupted"
  - "Row count validation: Ensure all records were migrated"
  - "Business rule validation: Verify data meets business constraints"
rollbackStrategies:
  - "Automated rollback: Trigger rollback based on failure conditions"
  - "Manual rollback: Human-initiated rollback procedures"
  - "Point-in-time recovery: Restore to specific timestamp"
  - "Snapshot rollback: Restore from pre-migration snapshot"
  - "Partial rollback: Rollback specific components or data subsets"
performanceOptimization:
  - "Batch processing: Process data in optimal batch sizes"
  - "Parallel processing: Use multiple threads/processes for migration"
  - "Index optimization: Drop/recreate indexes for faster migration"
  - "Connection pooling: Optimize database connections"
  - "Resource monitoring: Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O during migration"
migrationTesting:
  - "Unit tests: Test individual migration scripts"
  - "Integration tests: Test migration with application code"
  - "Performance tests: Verify migration performance under load"
  - "Rollback tests: Test rollback procedures regularly"
  - "Data consistency tests: Verify data integrity after migration"

  - "Liquibase: Database-independent migration tool"
  - "Alembic: Database migration tool for Python/SQLAlchemy"
  - "Rails migrations: Built-in migration system for Ruby on Rails"
  - "Entity Framework migrations: .NET database migration tool"
monitoringAndObservability:
  - "Migration progress: Track completion percentage and ETA"
  - "Performance metrics: Monitor throughput and latency"
  - "Error tracking: Log and alert on migration failures"
  - "Resource utilization: Monitor system resources during migration"
  - "Business impact: Track impact on application performance"
