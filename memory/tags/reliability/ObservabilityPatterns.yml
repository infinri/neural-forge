description: "Comprehensive observability patterns for monitoring, logging, and tracing"
appliesTo:
  - "Distributed system monitoring"
  - "Application performance monitoring"
  - "Troubleshooting and debugging"
  - "Service level objective (SLO) tracking"
  - "Incident response and root cause analysis"
patterns:
  - "Implement the three pillars: metrics, logs, and traces"
  - "Use structured logging with consistent formats"
  - "Implement distributed tracing across service boundaries"
  - "Create meaningful dashboards and alerts"
  - "Use correlation IDs to track requests across services"
bestPractices:
  - "Instrument code at development time, not as an afterthought"
  - "Use consistent naming conventions for metrics and logs"
  - "Implement proper sampling strategies for high-volume systems"
  - "Focus on user-centric metrics and business KPIs"
  - "Create runbooks linking alerts to remediation steps"
  - "Implement proper data retention policies"
  - "Use observability data to drive system improvements"
metricsPatterns:
  - "RED metrics: Rate, Errors, Duration for services"
  - "USE metrics: Utilization, Saturation, Errors for resources"
  - "Golden signals: Latency, traffic, errors, saturation"
  - "Business metrics: User registrations, revenue, conversions"
  - "SLI/SLO metrics: Service level indicators and objectives"
loggingPatterns:
  - "Structured logging: Use JSON or similar structured formats"
  - "Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL with appropriate usage"
  - "Contextual logging: Include request IDs, user IDs, session info"
  - "Centralized logging: Aggregate logs from all services"
  - "Log sampling: Sample high-volume logs to manage costs"
tracingPatterns:
  - "Distributed tracing: Track requests across service boundaries"
  - "Span creation: Create spans for significant operations"
  - "Trace context propagation: Pass trace context between services"
  - "Sampling strategies: Head-based and tail-based sampling"
  - "Trace analysis: Use traces for performance optimization"
alertingStrategies:
  - "Symptom-based alerts: Alert on user-visible problems"
  - "Threshold-based alerts: Static limits for key metrics"
  - "Anomaly detection: Machine learning-based alerting"
  - "Alert fatigue prevention: Proper alert tuning and grouping"
  - "Escalation policies: Progressive notification strategies"
dashboardDesign:
  - "Service dashboards: Key metrics for each service"
  - "Business dashboards: Revenue, user engagement, conversions"
  - "Infrastructure dashboards: System resource utilization"
  - "SLO dashboards: Service level objective tracking"
  - "Incident dashboards: Real-time incident status and impact"
correlationTechniques:
  - "Request correlation: Track requests across multiple services"
  - "User journey tracking: Follow user interactions through the system"
  - "Error correlation: Link errors to their root causes"
  - "Performance correlation: Connect performance issues to their sources"
  - "Business impact correlation: Link technical issues to business metrics"
toolsAndPlatforms:
  - "Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, New Relic"
  - "Logging: ELK stack, Splunk, Fluentd, Loki"
  - "Tracing: Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray, Google Cloud Trace"
  - "APM: New Relic, DataDog, AppDynamics, Dynatrace"
  - "Unified platforms: Honeycomb, Lightstep, Observe"
