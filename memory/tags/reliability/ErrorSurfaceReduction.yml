description: >
  Minimize potential failure points and improve system reliability through defensive programming.
appliesTo:
  - Error handling
  - Input validation
  - API design
  - Resource management
  - State management
strategies:
  - Fail fast with clear error messages
  - Use type systems to catch errors early
  - Implement circuit breakers
  - Graceful degradation patterns
  - Defensive copying of mutable data
  - Null/undefined checks
bestPractices:
  - Return errors, don't throw exceptions for expected failures
  - Use Result/Option types where available
  - Validate preconditions early
  - Clean up resources in finally blocks
  - Log errors with sufficient context
  - Avoid silent failures
patterns:
  - Try-catch-finally blocks
  - Error boundaries in UI components
  - Bulkhead pattern for isolation
  - Timeout mechanisms
  - Retry with exponential backoff
