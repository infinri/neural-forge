description: "Encryption at rest and in transit implementation patterns"
appliesTo:
  - "Data encryption and decryption"
  - "Database encryption strategies"
  - "File system encryption"
  - "Network communication security"
  - "Key management and rotation"
patterns:
  - "Use AES-256 for symmetric encryption of data at rest"
  - "Implement RSA or ECC for asymmetric encryption"
  - "Use TLS 1.3 for all network communications"
  - "Encrypt sensitive database columns individually"
  - "Implement proper key derivation functions (PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2)"
bestPractices:
  - "Never implement custom encryption algorithms"
  - "Use cryptographically secure random number generators"
  - "Implement proper initialization vector (IV) generation"
  - "Use authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM)"
  - "Separate encryption keys from encrypted data"
  - "Implement key rotation without service interruption"
  - "Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage"
encryptionAtRest:
  - "Database: Transparent data encryption (TDE) or column-level encryption"
  - "Files: Full disk encryption or file-level encryption"
  - "Backups: Encrypt all backup files with separate keys"
  - "Logs: Encrypt sensitive log data before storage"
  - "Configuration: Encrypt configuration files containing secrets"
encryptionInTransit:
  - "HTTPS/TLS: Use TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites"
  - "Database connections: Use SSL/TLS for all database communications"
  - "Message queues: Encrypt messages in transit and at rest"
  - "API calls: Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication"
  - "Email: Use S/MIME or PGP for sensitive email communications"
keyManagement:
  - "Generate keys using cryptographically secure random generators"
  - "Store keys separately from encrypted data"
  - "Implement key escrow for disaster recovery"
  - "Use key derivation functions for password-based encryption"
  - "Implement automatic key rotation policies"
  - "Use key versioning for seamless key updates"
algorithmSelection:
  - "Symmetric: AES-256-GCM for most use cases"
  - "Asymmetric: RSA-4096 or ECC P-384 for key exchange"
  - "Hashing: SHA-256 or SHA-3 for integrity verification"
  - "Password hashing: Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt"
  - "Message authentication: HMAC-SHA256"
implementationSecurity:
  - "Use constant-time comparison for cryptographic operations"
  - "Clear sensitive data from memory after use"
  - "Implement proper error handling without information leakage"
  - "Use secure coding practices to prevent timing attacks"
  - "Validate all cryptographic inputs and parameters"
complianceConsiderations:
  - "FIPS 140-2 compliance for government applications"
  - "Common Criteria certification for high-security environments"
  - "GDPR compliance for personal data encryption"
  - "PCI DSS requirements for payment card data"
  - "HIPAA compliance for healthcare data encryption"
