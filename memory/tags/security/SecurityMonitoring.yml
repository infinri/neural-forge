description: "Security logging, monitoring, and incident detection patterns"
appliesTo:
  - "Security event logging and analysis"
  - "Intrusion detection and prevention"
  - "Security incident response"
  - "Compliance monitoring and reporting"
  - "Threat intelligence integration"
patterns:
  - "Log all security-relevant events with sufficient detail"
  - "Implement real-time security event correlation"
  - "Use SIEM systems for centralized security monitoring"
  - "Implement automated threat detection and response"
  - "Maintain security event retention for compliance"
bestPractices:
  - "Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)"
  - "Use structured logging formats (JSON) for better analysis"
  - "Implement log integrity protection (digital signatures)"
  - "Set up automated alerts for critical security events"
  - "Implement proper log rotation and archival policies"
  - "Use correlation IDs to track security events across systems"
  - "Implement rate limiting on logging to prevent DoS"
securityEvents:
  - "Authentication attempts (success/failure with context)"
  - "Authorization failures and privilege escalation attempts"
  - "Data access patterns and anomalous queries"
  - "Configuration changes and administrative actions"
  - "Network connection attempts and firewall blocks"
  - "File system access and modification events"
  - "Application errors that might indicate attacks"
monitoringMetrics:
  - "Failed login attempts per user/IP/time window"
  - "Unusual data access patterns or volume spikes"
  - "Geographic anomalies in user access patterns"
  - "Time-based access pattern deviations"
  - "API usage patterns and rate limit violations"
  - "Error rate spikes that might indicate attacks"
alertingStrategies:
  - "Immediate alerts for critical security events"
  - "Threshold-based alerts for suspicious patterns"
  - "Machine learning-based anomaly detection"
  - "Correlation-based alerts for multi-stage attacks"
  - "Time-based alerts for off-hours activities"
incidentResponse:
  - "Automated containment for detected threats"
  - "Incident escalation procedures and contact lists"
  - "Evidence preservation for forensic analysis"
  - "Communication plans for security incidents"
  - "Post-incident review and improvement processes"
complianceLogging:
  - "Audit trails for regulatory compliance (SOX, HIPAA, GDPR)"
  - "Data access logging for privacy compliance"
  - "Change management logging for operational compliance"
  - "Retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements"
  - "Regular compliance reporting and validation"
threatIntelligence:
  - "Integration with threat intelligence feeds"
  - "IP reputation checking and blocking"
  - "Malware signature detection and prevention"
  - "Behavioral analysis for advanced persistent threats"
  - "Threat hunting and proactive security measures"
logAnalysis:
  - "Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis"
  - "Implement Splunk or similar SIEM solutions"
  - "Use machine learning for anomaly detection"
  - "Implement log correlation and pattern matching"
  - "Create security dashboards for real-time monitoring"
