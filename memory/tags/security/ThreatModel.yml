  Systematic approach to identifying and mitigating security threats.
appliesTo:
  - System architecture
  - API design
  - Data flow analysis
  - Access control
  - Input validation
methodology:
  - STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Elevation)
  - Attack trees and threat scenarios
  - Risk assessment (likelihood Ã— impact)
  - Mitigation strategies
  - Regular threat reviews
threats:
  - Authentication bypass
  - Data injection attacks
  - Privilege escalation
  - Information leakage
  - Denial of service
  - Man-in-the-middle
mitigations:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Encryption in transit and at rest
  - Rate limiting and monitoring
  - Secure coding practices
  - Regular security audits
