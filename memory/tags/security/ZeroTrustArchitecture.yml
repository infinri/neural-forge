description: "Zero trust security model implementation patterns"
appliesTo:
  - "Network security architecture"
  - "Identity and access management"
  - "Microservices security"
  - "Cloud security implementation"
  - "Device and endpoint security"
patterns:
  - "Never trust, always verify every request"
  - "Implement least privilege access controls"
  - "Use micro-segmentation for network isolation"
  - "Verify device identity and health before access"
  - "Implement continuous authentication and authorization"
bestPractices:
  - "Authenticate and authorize every network connection"
  - "Encrypt all communications end-to-end"
  - "Log and monitor all network traffic and access attempts"
  - "Implement device compliance checking before network access"
  - "Use identity-based access controls rather than network location"
  - "Implement just-in-time (JIT) access for administrative functions"
  - "Regularly validate and update access permissions"
coreComponents:
  - "Identity verification: Multi-factor authentication for all users"
  - "Device verification: Certificate-based device authentication"
  - "Network micro-segmentation: Isolate resources and limit lateral movement"
  - "Data classification: Classify and protect data based on sensitivity"
  - "Policy enforcement: Centralized policy engine for access decisions"
implementationLayers:
  - "Identity layer: User and service identity verification"
  - "Device layer: Endpoint security and compliance validation"
  - "Network layer: Micro-segmentation and traffic inspection"
  - "Application layer: API security and application-level controls"
  - "Data layer: Data classification and protection mechanisms"
accessControl:
  - "Risk-based authentication: Adjust authentication requirements based on risk"
  - "Conditional access: Grant access based on multiple factors"
  - "Privileged access management: Special controls for administrative access"
  - "Session management: Continuous validation of active sessions"
  - "Access reviews: Regular validation of user permissions and access"
networkSecurity:
  - "Software-defined perimeter (SDP): Create secure network overlays"
  - "Network access control (NAC): Validate devices before network access"
  - "Intrusion detection and prevention: Monitor for malicious activity"
  - "Traffic inspection: Deep packet inspection for all network traffic"
  - "Lateral movement prevention: Limit communication between network segments"
monitoringAndAnalytics:
  - "User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA): Detect anomalous behavior"
  - "Security information and event management (SIEM): Centralized logging"
  - "Threat intelligence: Integrate external threat data"
  - "Risk scoring: Assign risk scores to users, devices, and activities"
  - "Incident response: Automated response to detected threats"
cloudImplementation:
  - "Cloud access security broker (CASB): Control cloud service access"
  - "Cloud workload protection: Secure cloud-based applications"
  - "Container security: Secure containerized applications"
  - "Serverless security: Secure function-as-a-service implementations"
  - "Multi-cloud security: Consistent security across cloud providers"
